## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
  This assignment is prepared and submitted by me alone. This project intends to provide insight into the Ridge and Lasso methods of Regression analysis.
- What is the background of your project?
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
  A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. 
- What is the dataset that is being used?
train.csv
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
The variables that proved significant for the predictions are:
    workingday, atemp, hum, windspeed, spring, winter, Year_1, Weekday_6, Light Snow, Mist + Cloudy, mid_of_month 

The model built using these variables has provided an explainability of 83%.
The test data provided an explainability (R-Squared) of 80.77%.

This indicates that the model can be used effectively.


## Technologies Used
- Numpy, Pandas, sklear, statsmodel, matplotlib, seaborn
